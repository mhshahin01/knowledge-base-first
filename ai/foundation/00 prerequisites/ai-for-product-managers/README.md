# AI for Product Managers

> Last updated: 2026-09-02 | Audience: product managers, founders, and anyone who decides *what* to build with AI agents without writing the code
> Format: a series of eight linked tutorials, 15–25 minutes each | No code, no math beyond arithmetic
> Source: a consolidation of the technical series in `../../agentic-ai/tutorials/` (001–011), retold from the product seat

## What this series is

Your engineers are building with AI agents, or your roadmap says they should be. This series gives you
the mental models to lead that work: what agents are, why they fail, what they cost, how they remember,
how they learn your documents, how they connect to your systems, how to keep them safe, and how to ship
and measure them. Every concept is explained with plain-language analogies and product examples, and every
part ends with the questions you should be asking your team.

It consolidates a technical tutorial series for engineers. You do not need to read that series; where a
topic has a deeper technical treatment, each part links to it for the curious (or for forwarding to your
engineers).

## How to read it

In order, the first time: each part assumes the vocabulary of the ones before it. After that, each part
stands alone as a reference. Parts 1–2 are the foundation everything else uses; parts 3–7 are the
capability areas; part 8 is the one to reread before every launch.

## The parts

| # | Part | The question it answers | Read in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [What Is an AI Agent?](01-what-is-an-ai-agent.md) | When is "an agent" the right thing to build, and when is it overkill? | 20 min |
| 2 | [Why Agents Fail, and What They Cost](02-why-agents-fail-and-what-they-cost.md) | Why do demos impress and products disappoint, and how do I forecast the bill? | 25 min |
| 3 | [Memory and Conversations](03-memory-and-conversations.md) | What does "the agent remembers" actually mean, and what are the privacy stakes? | 20 min |
| 4 | [Giving Agents Knowledge: RAG](04-giving-agents-knowledge-rag.md) | How does an agent answer from *our* documents, and why does it still make things up? | 20 min |
| 5 | [Tools, Integrations, and MCP](05-tools-integrations-and-mcp.md) | How does an agent touch our systems, and when does a standard beat custom glue? | 20 min |
| 6 | [Trust, Safety, and Control](06-trust-safety-and-control.md) | What keeps an agent from doing something we will regret? | 25 min |
| 7 | [Voice and Realtime Agents](07-voice-and-realtime-agents.md) | What changes when the user talks instead of types? | 15 min |
| 8 | [Measuring Quality and Shipping](08-measuring-quality-and-shipping.md) | How do we know it works, and what does "production-ready" actually mean? | 25 min |

## The running examples

Two product examples recur across the series, chosen because one is generic and one is higher-stakes:

- **A support copilot for an online store**: answers customer questions, looks up orders, processes
  returns. Generic enough to map onto your product.
- **An exam-prep coach**: grades IELTS practice essays against the official band descriptors, builds
  AWS certification mock tests from the current exam guide, and runs spoken mock speaking tests. Used
  wherever the series needs a higher-stakes example: a learner's essays, recordings, and scores are
  personal data, and a wrong readiness verdict costs a real exam fee.

## The one-sentence summary of the whole series

An AI agent is a model that decides and acts in a loop; everything else, memory, knowledge, tools,
safety, voice, measurement, is engineering wrapped around that loop, and the product manager's job is
to decide *how much* loop the problem needs and *what must surround it* before real users arrive.

## For your engineers

Each part links to the corresponding technical tutorial in `../../agentic-ai/tutorials/`, where the
same concepts are built in code with Pydantic AI. The two series are aligned by design: you can discuss
part 4 with your team while they work through RAG, and you will be talking about the same thing.
